- Flexible choice; student not paired indefinitely. Tutors can look through the
  tutors (see interests and book them and reschedule meeting every month or jump
  between tutors).
- Using Google Calendar (different calendar for each subject offered).

Issues:

- People are already logged into Google Account and aren't connecting that it's
  synced to their email (don't find calendar invite; should instead use SMS).
- No way to configure required forms for Google Appointments (e.g. they want
  their phone number to contact the student).

1. Student opens the Google Calendar (different calendar for each subject).
2. Student clicks on appointment slot and schedules meeting with tutor (sends
   the Google Meet link to both the tutor and student).
